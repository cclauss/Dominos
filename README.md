# Dominos-game-Pygame-

This is an animated Dominos game programmed in Python using Pygame modules.

Rules:
- You and the computer player each draw 7 pieces.
- The highest double piece on either hand is played.
- You and the computer player take turns playing fitting pieces.
- You score only, if the sum of both ends of the line of dominos on the table is devisible by 3 or 5.
  The score equals the sum devided by 3 or 5.
  Examples:
  - ends = 3 + 6 = 9. 9 is not devisable by 3 or 5. Score = 0.
  - ends = 4 + 6 = 10. 10 is devisable by 5. Score = 10 / 5 = 2.
- The game ends, when one of the players runs out of pieces.
- The player with the higher score wins.

Controls:
Use the arrow keys to select the piece you want to play and press enter.
